## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from 10 v1 requirements. Phase 3 (Market Context) depends on Phase 1 only (not Phase 2), enabling parallel work with Phase 2 if desired.
- [Roadmap]: Payment (PAY-01, PAY-02) is v1.1 scope -- not in current roadmap. Ship free, validate with 20-50 users, then add Stripe.
- [Phase 01]: Used NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY env var name per latest Supabase docs
- [Phase 01]: Supabase browser client created inside handlers to prevent SSR prerender crashes
- [Phase 01]: Warm earthy shadcn base theme: sage for primary, terracotta for accents, light mode only
- [Phase 01]: Used zod/v4 import path for Zod 4.x compatibility
- [Phase 01]: Root page is client component for inline guest result display
- [Phase 01]: Server action handles both auth and guest flows in single analyzeUrl function

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 2 (BRF Analysis) as highest-risk: Claude structured output for Swedish K2/K3 formats needs deeper research during planning.
- Research flags Inngest + Supabase Realtime wiring in Phase 1 as non-trivial -- may need research spike.
